			My Experiences:-
		</div>
		<div class="rep5"> I am the student from the science background and I am new to this field and I have totally new experience while doing this project. This was my first professional web design and I faced many problems during the coding of the pages. As I was new to the HTML and CSS I faced many problems but I managed to do the project before time. I was totally new to this course and some I managed to learn these  subjects . The whole  credits goes to the study environment of my college and hardworking teachers. The learning environment of my college is very effective and peaceful. At first starting the college, I was known to these development methods and I worked really hard for the module. This changed my point of view towards the web and css. I used to learn HTML in class 8 and 9. Now while studing in UoN ,this recreated my memory and I was able to remember some of my tasks done at that time. After learning the HTML and CSS I am able to do make basic web pages using various techniques. For this assessment I take help of many senios and my teachers . My teachers were like god form me. They
		helped me with may all problems that I faced during the develpoment of this project.<br><br> The group work played important role in my project develpoment. My  team members were friendly,  co-operative and helping. They helped me alot with my problems. I worked with my team for design work, it helped me very much while desiging my wireframes.  Workig with team helped me to do creative works and made me self-confident. It improved my writing, learning skills, and helped me to think critically gor better results.

			<b>UI Design:-</b>
		</div>
		<div class="rep5">
			I researched many online websites to  make a intersting webpage for my assessment. During this I found many attractive and responsive websites from where i was in fluenced .The influences of these sites can be seen in my web page . I have taken some design ideas from these websites. It very hard to finilize the design idea. They all have the different design and UI interfaces. they had many advantages and disadvantages of these UI designs. My plan was to improve the UI designs and make a attractive and responsive design. Here are the screenshots of the UI design that I was influenced by: They are the website of my college i.e NAMI college <a href="http://nami.edu.np/">http://nami.edu.np/ </a> and one of the ISP company  of Nepal which is WOrldlink communication <a href="https://worldlink.com.np/">https://worldlink.com.np/</a>.
